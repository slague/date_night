#I am creating a list of movies called "created for you"
#The list is made up of movies and scores, 

# Each movie has a specific score 
# scores will be between 1-100
# No two movies have the same score - does this mean my list cannot be larger than 100? 

# When a new movie is added to the list, it is done so with its score 
# the score tells you how likely a user is to like that movie 

#Take new movies that have already been assigned a score, and store them in a binary tree

#A binary search tree:
  #has nodes
    #a node has a left pointer, a right pointer, and a data element 
    #nodes to the left of a node are less than or equal tothe that node, 
    #nodes to the right are greater than

#the size of the search tree is the number of nodes
# the depth of the tree is
